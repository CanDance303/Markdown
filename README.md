[Page Two](PageTwo.md) will tell you a little more about me!

It's been pretty cold lately, to check out when warmer weather may be on the way go to the National Weather Service's site: https://www.weather.gov

I highly recommend a nice cup of coffee on these cold winter days (or any day really).

```python
for num in range(1, 100):
    if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif num % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif num % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(num)
```

P.S. if you don't believe me about the cow, watch this: [Cow plays soccer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59onAKs2OtE)
